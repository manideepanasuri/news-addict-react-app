# News Addict: React App for News Aggregation

This React application, [News Addict](https://github.com/manideepanasuri/news-addict-react-app), allows users to explore news articles from various sources by fetching data from an external API and dynamically rendering the content.

## Technologies Used

*   **Frontend:**
    *   React: JavaScript library for building user interfaces with a component-based architecture.
    *   Axios or Fetch API: For making HTTP requests to the news API.

## Features

*   **News Fetching:** Fetches news articles from an external API based on user preferences or categories.
*   **Dynamic Content Rendering:** Dynamically renders the retrieved news articles in a user-friendly format, potentially including elements like headlines, summaries, images, and links to the original source.
